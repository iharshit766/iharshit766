# DSA Code Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) code repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in java programming language.

## Data Structures

Explore the implementation of common data structures such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Each data structure includes example code.

## Algorithms

Discover implementations of fundamental algorithms like:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Dynamic Programming solutions
- Greedy algorithms
- Backtracking algorithms

Code examples are provided in java.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding new implementations, optimizing existing code, or fixing bugs.

Happy coding!
